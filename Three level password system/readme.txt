Project Overview
The Three-Level Password Authentication System is designed to enhance security in user authentication by implementing a multi-tiered approach. This system aims to provide robust protection against unauthorized access by requiring users to pass through three distinct levels of authentication, each with increasing complexity.

System Features
Three Levels of Authentication:
Level 1: Textual Password
Users enter a predefined text password. This is the first line of defense against unauthorized access.
Level 2: Color Combination
Users must select a correct combination of colors from a provided list. This adds an additional layer of security.
Level 3: Image Ordering
Users are required to select images in a specific order from a shuffled set. This level is designed to be more challenging and secure.
User-Friendly Interface:
The system is designed with a simple and intuitive interface to enhance user experience.
Strong Security:
The multi-level approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, making it difficult for attackers to breach the system.
Customizable Options:
Users can set their own passwords and select images/colors according to their preferences.
Advantages
Enhanced Security: The multi-level authentication process makes it difficult for attackers, even if they manage to bypass the first level.
User-Friendly: The interface is designed to be simple and easy to navigate.
Flexibility: Users have the option to customize their passwords and authentication methods.
Disadvantages
Password Recovery: If users forget their passwords, there is currently no mechanism in place for password recovery.
Conclusion
The Three-Level Password Authentication System represents a significant advancement in user authentication methods. By combining different types of authentication, it addresses the vulnerabilities associated with traditional password systems and provides a more secure environment for sensitive information.
Future Enhancements
Password Recovery Mechanism: Implementing a secure method for users to recover forgotten passwords.
Additional Authentication Methods: Exploring biometric or token-based authentication for further security enhancements.
